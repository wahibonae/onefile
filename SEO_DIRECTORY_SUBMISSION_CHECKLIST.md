### Long Description (150-300 words)
Break through AI platform upload limits with OneFile, the free tool that combines unlimited files into a single AI-ready format. If you've hit ChatGPT's 3-file restriction, Claude's context limits, or Gemini's file size barriers, OneFile is your solution.

Simply drag and drop individual files, entire folders, or import directly from GitHub. OneFile intelligently processes 50+ file types - PDFs, Microsoft Office documents (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), code files, text documents, CSVs, and more - into one perfectly formatted text file.

Perfect for students combining research papers, developers sharing codebases, professionals merging meeting notes, and anyone frustrated with AI upload restrictions. OneFile automatically filters unnecessary files (images, binaries, dependencies), respects .gitignore rules, and preserves file structure for context.

Key features:
- Bypass ChatGPT's 3-file limit instantly (and 10-file batch limit for Plus users)
- Support for 50+ file types
- GitHub repository import
- Smart filtering (.gitignore support)
- 100% private and secure (browser-based processing)
